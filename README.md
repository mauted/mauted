## Hello! My name is Mauricio. ðŸ‘‹

I am fascinated by the intersection of software development and scientific discovery. I am passionate about leveraging my coding expertise to develop modern solutions for pressing issues in research and enterprise.

I recently completed a research internship Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich, where I designed and tested novel algorithms and architectures for brain-inspired systems. Previously, I was a software engineer at Wayfair, where I improved the accessibility and security of essential data and applications for internal platforms. I also have experience as a peer tutor, where I supported undergraduate students in learning fundamental concepts and skills in computer science and mathematics.

I am always eager to learn and grow, and to expand the frontiers of technology and design with my curiosity and creativity. Whether I am developing cutting-edge frontend applications or diving deep into the intricacies of complex algorithms, I am committed to making innovative contributions to the fields of technology and science. I am also open to collaborating and connecting with like-minded thinkers, and to exploring new possibilities and opportunities.

## Areas of interest

I have a broad spectrum of interests. Full disclosure, I am not an expert in all of these but I strive to learn about all of these areas.

- **Computer science:** Optimization, machine learning, formal verification, quantum computation, software architecture.
- **Physics:** Statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum mechanics, fluid mechanics.
- **Mathematics:** Combinatorics, cryptography, geometry (algebraic, differential), algorithms.
- **Engineering:** Aerospace engineering, computer hardware.
