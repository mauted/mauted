## Hello! My name is Mauricio. ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer and researcher driven by an insatiable curiosity for physics, mathematics, and the universe's deepest mysteries. As a recent graduate with real-world experience, I am passionate about building apps that change the world.

My ambitions include pioneering research or entrepreneurial ventures that unify physics and software. Inspired by the laws of nature, I use first-principles thinking as my compass. I tackle problems with creative solutions, striving to push the limits of our imagination. 

I am always excited to chat with forward-thinking minds who share my vision to leverage science and technology to improve our quality of life.

Let's prepare the way for the future and beyond.
